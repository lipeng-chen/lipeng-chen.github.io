  This paper presents a novel multi-modal perception framework that integrates visual, LiDAR, and radar data for robust autonomous navigation in challenging urban environments. 
  
  **Key innovations:**
  - Cross-modal fusion architecture with attention mechanisms
  - Self-supervised calibration between sensor modalities
  - Real-time processing on embedded hardware platforms
