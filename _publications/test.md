abstract: |
  This paper presents a novel robust control framework for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) operating in dynamic ocean environments. 
  
  **Key contributions:**
  - Developed a hybrid adaptive control algorithm
  - Implemented real-time environmental disturbance estimation
  - Validated through extensive field trials in the South China Sea
  
  > "Our approach demonstrates a 40% improvement in trajectory tracking accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods." - Reviewer #2
