abstract: "This paper introduces Input Constrained Control Barrier Functions (ICCBFs) as a method to synthesize safety-critical controllers for nonlinear control-affine systems with input constraints. The method identifies a subset of the safe set of states and constructs a controller to render it forward invariant. We show ICCBFs generalize Higher Order CBFs, applicable to systems of non-uniform relative degree. Results are presented for adaptive cruise control and spacecraft rendezvous problems."
