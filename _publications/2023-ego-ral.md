# abstract: |
#   This paper presents a novel multi-modal perception framework that integrates visual, LiDAR, and radar data for robust autonomous navigation in challenging urban environments. 
  
#   **Key innovations:**
#   - Cross-modal fusion architecture with attention mechanisms
#   - Self-supervised calibration between sensor modalities
#   - Real-time processing on embedded hardware platforms
